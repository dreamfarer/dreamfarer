## Hi, I'm dreamfarer ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software engineering student at the University of Zurich (UZH), currently working toward my bachelor's degree. In my free time, I love to code and contribute to projects that spark my interest â€“ whether it's creating mods and supplements for games, building helpful applications and frameworks, or writing guides to make life just a bit easier.

### Repositories
Below are a few repositories I'm especially proud of:
- [CLIBB](https://github.com/dreamfarer/clibb): A Python library that streamlines, simplifies, and speeds up command-line interface creation.
- [ARES](https://github.com/dreamfarer/ARMA-3-ARTILLERY-CALCULATOR-ARES): An artillery computer for the video game Arma 3.
- [UZH](https://github.com/dreamfarer/UZH): A collaborative effort by 11 students at UZH, offering extra resources and sample solutions for course assignments.
